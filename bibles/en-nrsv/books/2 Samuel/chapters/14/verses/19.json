{"verse":"19","text":"The king said, \"Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?\" The woman answered and said, \"As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn right or left from anything that my lord the king has said. For it was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words into the mouth of your servant."}
