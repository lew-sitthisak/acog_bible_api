{"verse":"16","text":"But when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented concerning the evil, and said to the angel who was bringing destruction among the people, \"It is enough; now stay your hand.\" The angel of the LORD was then by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."}
