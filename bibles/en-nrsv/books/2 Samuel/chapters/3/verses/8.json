{"verse":"8","text":"The words of Ishbaal made Abner very angry; he said, \"Am I a dog's head for Judah? Today I keep showing loyalty to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me now with a crime concerning this woman."}
