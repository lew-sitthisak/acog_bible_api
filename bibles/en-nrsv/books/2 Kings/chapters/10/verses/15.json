{"verse":"15","text":"When he left there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him; he greeted him, and said to him, \"Is your heart as true to mine as mine is to yours?\" Jehonadab answered, \"It is.\" Jehu said, \"If it is, give me your hand.\" So he gave him his hand. Jehu took him up with him into the chariot."}
