{"verse":"8","text":"and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, directing him to give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple fortress, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.\" And the king granted me what I asked, for the gracious hand of my God was upon me."}
