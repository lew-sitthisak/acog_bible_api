{"verse":"13","text":"I also shook out the fold of my garment and said, \"So may God shake out everyone from house and from property who does not perform this promise. Thus may they be shaken out and emptied.\" And all the assembly said, \"Amen,\" and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised."}
