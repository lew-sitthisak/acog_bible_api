{"verse":"39","text":"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \"Blessed be the LORD who has judged the case of Nabal's insult to me, and has kept back his servant from evil; the LORD has returned the evildoing of Nabal upon his own head.\" Then David sent and wooed Abigail, to make her his wife."}
