{"verse":"7","text":"Afterward, says the LORD, I will give King Zedekiah of Judah, and his servants, and the people in this city-- those who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine-- into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword; he shall not pity them, or spare them, or have compassion."}
