{"verse":"19","text":"The LORD said to Moses, \"Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt-- over its rivers, its canals, and its ponds, and all its pools of water-- so that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout the whole land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'\""}
