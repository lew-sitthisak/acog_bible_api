{"verse":"15","text":"And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but when he was about to destroy it, the LORD took note and relented concerning the calamity; he said to the destroying angel, \"Enough! Stay your hand.\" The angel of the LORD was then standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."}
