{"verse":"13","text":"Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the vacant area are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings; there they shall deposit the most holy offerings-- the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering-- for the place is holy."}
