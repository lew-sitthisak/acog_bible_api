{"verse":"14","text":"Thus says the LORD: The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, tall of stature, shall come over to you and be yours, they shall follow you; they shall come over in chains and bow down to you. They will make supplication to you, saying, \"God is with you alone, and there is no other; there is no god besides him.\""}
