{"verse":"4","text":"For thus the LORD said to me, As a lion or a young lion growls over its prey, and-- when a band of shepherds is called out against it-- is not terrified by their shouting or daunted at their noise, so the LORD of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill."}
