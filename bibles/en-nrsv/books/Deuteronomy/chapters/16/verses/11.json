{"verse":"11","text":"Rejoice before the LORD your God-- you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, the Levites resident in your towns, as well as the strangers, the orphans, and the widows who are among you-- at the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name."}
