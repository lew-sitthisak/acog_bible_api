{"verse":"5","text":"But those prophets or those who divine by dreams shall be put to death for having spoken treason against the LORD your God-- who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery-- to turn you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from your midst."}
