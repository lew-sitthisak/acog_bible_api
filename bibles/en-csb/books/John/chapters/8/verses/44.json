{"verse":"44","text":"You are of your father the devil, and you want to carry out your fatherâ€™s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies."}
