{"verse":"11","text":"All the people who were at the city gate, including the elders, said, â€œWe are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is entering your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you be powerful in Ephrathah and your name well known in Bethlehem."}
