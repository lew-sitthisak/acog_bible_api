{"verse":"37","text":"We will bring a loaf from our first batch of dough to the priests at the storerooms of the house of our God. We will also bring the firstfruits of our grain offerings, of every fruit tree, and of the new wine and fresh oil. A tenth of our landâ€™s produce belongs to the Levites, for the Levites are to collect the one-tenth offering in all our agricultural towns."}
