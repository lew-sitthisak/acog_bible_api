{"verse":"15","text":"“If someone offends by sinning unintentionally in regard to any of the LORD’s holy things, he must bring his penalty for guilt to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock (based on your assessment of its value in silver shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel ) as a guilt offering."}
