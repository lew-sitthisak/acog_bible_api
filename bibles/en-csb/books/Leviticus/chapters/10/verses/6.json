{"verse":"6","text":"Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, â€œDo not let your hair hang loose and do not tear your clothes, or else you will die, and the LORD will become angry with the whole community. However, your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may weep over the conflagration the LORD ignited."}
