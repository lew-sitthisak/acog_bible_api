{"verse":"17","text":"David said to God, “Wasn’t I the one who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? LORD my God, please let your hand be against me and against my father’s family, but don’t let the plague be against your people.”"}
