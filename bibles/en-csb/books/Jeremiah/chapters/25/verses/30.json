{"verse":"30","text":"â€œAs for you, you are to prophesy all these things to them, and say to them: The LORD roars from on high; he makes his voice heard from his holy dwelling. He roars loudly over his grazing land; he calls out with a shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."}
