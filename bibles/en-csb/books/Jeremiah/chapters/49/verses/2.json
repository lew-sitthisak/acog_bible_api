{"verse":"2","text":"Therefore look, the days are coming  — this is the LORD’s declaration — when I will make the shout of battle heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a desolate mound, and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. Israel will dispossess their dispossessors, says the LORD."}
