{"verse":"28","text":"And you, my servant Jacob, do not be afraid — this is the LORD’s declaration — for I will be with you. I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have banished you, but I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you with justice, and I will by no means leave you unpunished."}
