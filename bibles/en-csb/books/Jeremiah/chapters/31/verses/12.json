{"verse":"12","text":"They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant with joy because of the LORDâ€™s goodness, because of the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil, and because of the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like an irrigated garden, and they will no longer grow weak from hunger."}
