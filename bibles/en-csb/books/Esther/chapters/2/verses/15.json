{"verse":"15","text":"Esther was the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai who had adopted her as his own daughter. When her turn came to go to the king, she did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the kingâ€™s eunuch, keeper of the women, suggested. Esther gained favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her."}
