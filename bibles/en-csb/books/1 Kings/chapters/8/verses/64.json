{"verse":"64","text":"On the same day, the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the LORDâ€™s temple because that was where he offered the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat of the fellowship offerings since the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to accommodate the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings."}
