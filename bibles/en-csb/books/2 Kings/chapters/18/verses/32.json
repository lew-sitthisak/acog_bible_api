{"verse":"32","text":"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land — a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey  — so that you may live and not die. But don’t listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you, saying, “The LORD will rescue us.”"}
