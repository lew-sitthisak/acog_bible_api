{"verse":"4","text":"Then the king commanded the high priest Hilkiah and the priests of the second rank and the doorkeepers to bring out of the LORDâ€™s sanctuary all the articles made for Baal, Asherah, and all the stars in the sky. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel."}
