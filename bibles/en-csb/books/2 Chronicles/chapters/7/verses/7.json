{"verse":"7","text":"Since the bronze altar that Solomon had made could not accommodate the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat of the fellowship offerings, Solomon first consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the LORDâ€™s temple and then offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings there."}
