{"verse":"15","text":"The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the kingâ€™s seer. Also, the gatekeepers were at each temple gate. None of them left their tasks because their Levite brothers had made preparations for them."}
