{"verse":"28","text":"And you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- for I will be with you. I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have banished you, but I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you with justice, but I will by no means leave you unpunished."}
