{"verse":"10","text":"Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people of Mizpah including the daughters of the king-- all those who remained in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the Ammonites."}
