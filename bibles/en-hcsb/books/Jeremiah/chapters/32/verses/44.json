{"verse":"44","text":"Fields will be purchased with silver, the transaction written on a scroll and sealed, and witnesses will be called on in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in Judah's cities-- the cities of the hill country, the cities of the Judean foothills, and the cities of the Negev-- because I will restore their fortunes.\" [This is] the LORD's declaration."}
