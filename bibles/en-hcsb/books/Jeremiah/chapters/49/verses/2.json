{"verse":"2","text":"Therefore look, the days are coming-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- when I will make the shout of battle heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a desolate mound, and its villages will be burned down. Israel will dispossess their dispossessors, says the LORD."}
