{"verse":"9","text":"I am going to send for all the families of the north'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'and [send for] My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will bring them against this land, against its residents, and against all these surrounding nations, and I will completely destroy them and make them a desolation, a derision, and ruins forever."}
