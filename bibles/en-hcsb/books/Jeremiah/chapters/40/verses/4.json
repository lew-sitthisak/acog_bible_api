{"verse":"4","text":"Now pay attention [to what I say]. Today I am setting you free from the chains that were on your hands. If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you. But if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, go no farther. Look-- the whole land is in front of you. Wherever it seems good and right for you to go, go there.""}
