{"verse":"17","text":""Therefore, this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed Me by proclaiming freedom, each man for his brother and for his neighbor. I hereby proclaim freedom for you"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "to the sword, to plague, and to famine! I will make you a horror to all the earth's kingdoms."}
