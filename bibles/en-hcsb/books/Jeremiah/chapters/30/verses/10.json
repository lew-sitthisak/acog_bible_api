{"verse":"10","text":"As for you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- and do not be dismayed, Israel, for I will without fail save you from far away, your descendants, from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and have calm and quiet with no one to frighten him."}
