{"verse":"32","text":"I am against those who prophesy false dreams"-- the LORD's declaration-- "telling them and leading My people astray with their falsehoods and their boasting. It was not I who sent or commanded them, and they are of no benefit at all to these people"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration."}
