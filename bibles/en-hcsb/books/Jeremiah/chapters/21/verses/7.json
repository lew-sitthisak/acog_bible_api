{"verse":"7","text":"Afterwards'"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "'King Zedekiah of Judah, his officers, and the people-- those in this city who survive the plague, the sword, and the famine-- I will hand over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, to their enemies, yes, to those who want to take their lives. He will put them to the sword; he won't spare them or show pity or compassion.'"}
