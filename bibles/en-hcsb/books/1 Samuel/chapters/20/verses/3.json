{"verse":"3","text":"But David said, "Your father certainly knows that you have come to look favorably on me. He has said, 'Jonathan must not know of this, or else he will be grieved.' " David also swore, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.""}
