{"verse":"34","text":"He then said, \"Go among the troops and say to them, 'Each man must bring me his ox or his sheep. Do the slaughtering here and then you can eat. Don't sin against the LORD by eating [meat] with the blood [in it.]' \" So every one of the troops brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there."}
