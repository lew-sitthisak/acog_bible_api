{"verse":"9","text":"Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah, and Jehu's soldiers captured him (he was hiding in Samaria). Then they brought him to Jehu, and they killed him. They buried him, for they said, \"He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat who sought the LORD with all his heart.\" So the house of Ahaziah had no one to exercise power over the kingdom."}
