{"verse":"10","text":"for every dispute that comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities-- whether it regards differences of bloodguilt, law, commandment, statutes, or judgments-- you are to warn them, so they will not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath will not come on you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not incur guilt."}
