{"verse":"6","text":"The priests were standing at their stations, as were the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, which King David had made to praise the LORD-- "for His faithful love endures forever"-- when David offered praise with them. Across from them, the priests were blowing trumpets, and all the people were standing."}
