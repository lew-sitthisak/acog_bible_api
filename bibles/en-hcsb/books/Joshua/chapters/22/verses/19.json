{"verse":"19","text":"But if the land you possess is defiled, cross over to the land the LORD possesses where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and take possession [of it] among us. But don't rebel against the LORD or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God."}
