{"verse":"19","text":"So the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt-- over their rivers, canals, ponds, and all their water reservoirs-- and they will become blood. There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone [containers].""}
