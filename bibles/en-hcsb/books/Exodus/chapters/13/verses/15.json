{"verse":"15","text":"When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn [male] in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of livestock. That is why I sacrifice to the LORD all the firstborn of the womb that are males, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.'"}
