{"verse":"18","text":"So King Joash of Judah took all the consecrated items that his ancestors-- Judah's kings Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah-- had consecrated, along with his own consecrated items and all the gold found in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and in the king's palace, and he sent [them] to Hazael king of Aram. Then Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem."}
