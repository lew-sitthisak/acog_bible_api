{"verse":"13","text":"Then the man said to me, \"The northern and southern chambers that face the temple yard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will deposit the most holy offerings-- the grain offerings, sin offerings, and restitution offerings-- for the place is holy."}
