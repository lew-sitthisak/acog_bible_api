{"verse":"27","text":"They do not lie down with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were placed under their heads. The punishment for their sins rested on their bones, although the terror of [these] warriors was [once] in the land of the living."}
