{"verse":"52","text":"You must also bear your disgrace, since you have been an advocate for your sisters. For they appear more righteous than you because of your sins, which you committed more abhorrently than they [did]. So you also, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, since you have made your sisters appear righteous."}
