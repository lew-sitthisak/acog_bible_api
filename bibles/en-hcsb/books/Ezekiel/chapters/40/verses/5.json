{"verse":"5","text":"Now there was a wall surrounding the outside of the temple. The measuring rod in the man's hand was six units of 21 inches; each unit was the standard length plus three inches. He measured the thickness of the [wall] structure; it was about 10 feet, and its height was the same."}
