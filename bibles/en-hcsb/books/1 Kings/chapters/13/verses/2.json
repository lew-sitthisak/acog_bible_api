{"verse":"2","text":"The man of God cried out against the altar by a revelation from the LORD: \"Altar, altar, this is what the LORD says, 'A son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah, and he will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who are burning incense on you. Human bones will be burned on you.'\""}
