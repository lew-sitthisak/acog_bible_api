{"verse":"11","text":"Then He said, \"Go out and stand on the mountain in the LORD's presence.\" At that moment, the LORD passed by. A great and mighty wind was tearing at the mountains and was shattering cliffs before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake."}
