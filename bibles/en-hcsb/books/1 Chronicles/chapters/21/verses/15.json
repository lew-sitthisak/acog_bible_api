{"verse":"15","text":"Then God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but when the angel was about to destroy the city, the LORD looked, relented concerning the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying [the people], \"Enough, withdraw your hand now!\" The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."}
