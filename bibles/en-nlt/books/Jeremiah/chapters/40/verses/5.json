{"verse":"5","text":"If you decide to stay, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. He has been appointed governor of Judah by the king of Babylon. Stay there with the people he rules. But it's up to you; go wherever you like.\" Then Nebuzaradan gave Jeremiah some food and money and let him go."}
