{"verse":"25","text":"As soon as Jehu had finished sacrificing the burnt offering, he commanded his guards and officers, \"Go in and kill all of them. Don't let a single one escape!\" So they killed them all with their swords, and the guards and officers dragged their bodies outside. Then Jehu's men went into the fortress of the temple of Baal."}
