{"verse":"19","text":"Summon all the prophets and worshipers of Baal, and call together all his priests. See to it that every one of them comes, for I am going to offer a great sacrifice to Baal. Any of Baal's worshipers who fail to come will be put to death.\" But Jehu's plan was to destroy all the worshipers of Baal."}
