{"verse":"23","text":"By your messengers you have mocked the Lord. You have said, \"With my many chariots I have conquered the highest mountains--yes, the remotest peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars and its choicest cypress trees. I have reached its farthest corners and explored its deepest forests."}
