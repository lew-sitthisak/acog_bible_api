{"verse":"5","text":"When these celebrations ended--and sometimes they lasted several days--Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, \"Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.\" This was Job's regular practice."}
