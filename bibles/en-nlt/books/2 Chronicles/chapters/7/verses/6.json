{"verse":"6","text":"The priests took their assigned positions, and so did the Levites who were singing, \"His faithful love endures forever!\" They accompanied the singing with music from the instruments King David had made for praising the LORD. On the other side of the Levites, the priests blew the trumpets, while all Israel stood."}
