{"verse":"13","text":"The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the LORD. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised the LORD with these words: \"He is so good! His faithful love endures forever!\" At that moment a cloud filled the Temple of the LORD."}
