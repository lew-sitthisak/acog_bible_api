{"verse":"11","text":"Then the people of Judah and Israel will unite under one leader, and they will return from exile together. What a day that will be--the day of Jezreel--when God will again plant his people in his land. 1In that day you will call your brothers Ammi--`My people.' And you will call your sisters Ruhamah--`The ones I love.'"}
