{"verse":"17","text":"The priests, who minister in the LORD's presence, will stand between the people and the altar, weeping. Let them pray, \"Spare your people, LORD! They belong to you, so don't let them become an object of mockery. Don't let their name become a proverb of unbelieving foreigners who say, `Where is the God of Israel? He must be helpless!'\""}
