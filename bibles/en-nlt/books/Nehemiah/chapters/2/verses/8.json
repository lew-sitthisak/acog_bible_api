{"verse":"8","text":"And please send a letter to Asaph, the manager of the king's forest, instructing him to give me timber. I will need it to make beams for the gates of the Temple fortress, for the city walls, and for a house for myself.\" And the king granted these requests, because the gracious hand of God was on me."}
