{"verse":"6","text":"\"A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?\" says the LORD Almighty. \"It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name. \"But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?'"}
