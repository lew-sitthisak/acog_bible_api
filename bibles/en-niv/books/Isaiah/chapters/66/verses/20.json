{"verse":"20","text":"And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD -on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,\" says the LORD. \"They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels."}
